 WazirX Public Rest API
Here’s our public API handed to you on a silver platter. You can use it to build tickers, price comparison apps, or anything that helps the crypto community. Use it responsibly. ❤️


## General Information
1. Base API Endpoint: https://api.wazirx.com
1. All public api will return either JSON or Array object.

### Public API Endpoints

1. #### MARKET STATUS
   GET `/api/v2/market-status`  [Live link](https://api.wazirx.com/api/v2/market-status)

    > "Market Status" will give you an overview of markets and assets. This is helpful when you want to track the configuration of our markets, track fees or status of withdrawal deposit, market configuration and more. This response is not recommended for price polling because accurate realtime price is not guaranteed as there could be some delays. We recommend using price ticker API for all price tracking activity.
    
    Response object will have 2 keys `markets`(all market related configs will be in this key) and `assets`(all assets related configs will be here).
